        "question":"What is FND?",
        "answer":"Functional Neurological Disorder involves a variety of motor, sensory and/or cognitive symptoms that arise due to a dysfunction in the way the nervous system functions. There is a disorder in the way the body sends and receives neural messages, in the absence of structural damage to the nervous system."
      },
      {
        "question":"Does this mean it’s just in my head?",
        "answer":"FND is a real condition, and the symptoms are involuntary. People are not making up the symptoms. Research shows that the brains of people with FND are different to those who are feigning symptoms, and also function differently to healthy control."
      },
      {
        "question":"Will this kill me?",
        "answer":"On its’ own FND is not a lethal condition, however some people may also have other comorbid conditions that can reduce a person’s overall lifespan. Managing risk of injury and complications during functional seizures is important to keep people safe."
      },
      {
        "question":"How is FND Diagnosed?",
        "answer":"FND is diagnosed through positive signs. Functional symptoms tend to be distractible, inconsistent and variable. Positive signs, such as a Hoover sign is used for leg weakness and a tremor entrainment test for functional tremors.People may undergo a series of tests such as a MRI, CT scan, lumbar puncture, v-EEG and blood tests to rule in, or rule out, any co-morbid and/or treatable conditions. Typically, these scans will be negative and positive signs are used to rule in a diagnosis of FND."
      },
      {
        "question":"What is a Hoover Sign?",
        "answer":"A Hoover sign is used to identify functional leg weakness. With a Hoover sign a person may have significant leg weakness in one leg when trying to consciously move the weaker leg, but this strength may temporarily return, when a person attempts to move their good leg. This indicates that the nerves controlling leg movement are intact, but cannot always be accessed during movement."
      },
      {
        "question":"What are the symptoms?",
        "answer":"People can be affected by a variety of motor, sensory or cognitive symptoms, including problems with walking, involuntary movements, tremors, paralysis, and limb weakness. People may experience seizures and/or sensory problems such as vision loss. People may also be affected by facial symptoms, and problems with swallowing and / or talking. Problems with continence may occur in some people. Not all symptoms occur in each person. A person may only have one type of symptoms. For some [not all] people, symptoms may change over time."
      },
      {
        "question":"When should I see a medical professional about a new symptom or change/worsening of current symptom(s)?",
        "answer":"Any new or worsening symptoms should be medically checked out. Symptoms may be worsened by a treatable medical condition such as a vitamin deficiency or another medical condition. Treating co-existing medical conditions may improve or resolve FND symptoms. People with FND can develop other medical conditions, so all new symptoms need to be medically reviewed."
      },
      {
        "question":"Why do my symptoms fluctuate so rapidly? - FND VARIABILITY",
        "answer":"One of the characteristics of FND symptoms is that they can be highly variable, with symptomsand level of function fluctuating over time and rapidly cycling between normal and abnormalfunction.",
        "answer1":"Sometimes a person might have constant symptoms e.g. loss of voice, paralysis or gaitdisorder, but often people find they have days where they are totally debilitated bysymptoms, days when partially affected and days where their function might be close tonormal.",
        "answer2":"Symptoms can fluctuate rapidly e.g. across the course of the day, or symptoms mightfluctuate over several weeks, months or years. Symptoms can worsen with self-directedattention to / focus on the symptom / affected limb. Symptoms may improve temporarily,with distraction. Automatic voluntary movements are affected, but people may find they canaccess learned movements. For example, people who used to be a dancer or runner, mayfind they can dance or run, but not be able to walk.",
        "answer3":"Being unpredictable can mean symptoms are harder to manage, it can create more distress and can lead to some people believing the symptoms are not real. The symptoms are in fact very real, and fluctuate, because the nervous system functioning is dynamic and is constantly changing due to internal and external cues."
      },
      {
        "question":"Why do people use different terminology when describing FND?",
        "answer":"Historically the condition has been known by a number of names that relate to old theoreticalpropositions, such as Conversion Disorder. Other outdated terms include psychogenic andpseudo, such as pseudo-seizures. The DSM 5 uses the term Functional Neurological Disorderand the ICD 11 lists it as Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder."
      },{
        "question":"Which medical professionals should I see?",
        "answer":"People require a holistic approach to treatment that meet their specific individual needs. Amulti-disciplinary team approach has the best evidence. This may include a neurologist todiagnose, review and manage the condition; a psychiatrist to treat any mental health comorbidities, including medication management and a team of allied health professionals,such as a physiotherapist, speech therapist, dietician, psychologist and occupationaltherapist. For people with chronic pain, a referral to a pain clinic may be required. The specifichealth professionals required will depend on the unique needs of the person, for example,for people without co-morbid psychiatric conditions or underlying trauma, psychiatry andpsychology may not be relevant.",
        "answer1":"In supporting the recovery and wellbeing of the person, consideration to the socialenvironment, including school and workplace may be important, to support inclusion in amanner that supports the person’s wellbeing. An Occupational Therapist can assist peoplewith return-to-work and return-to-school plans, including a graded approach to work orstudy, and addressing disability related accommodations."

        "question":"Will I have this forever? Will I get better?",
        "points":"When people receive a diagnosis of FND, they often have many questions, such as:",
        "p1":"• Will I get better?",
        "p2":"• What do I need to do to get better?",
        "p3":"• How long will it take to get better?",
        "p4":"• Is this permanent?",
        "p5":"• What will my life look like with this?",
        "p6":"• Will I keep getting worse?",
        "p7":"• What do I do about work, school, future plans etc?",
        "answer":"Unfortunately, outcomes are highly variable and often cannot be predicted. In general, younger people / children have better outcomes than adults. People who have complex comorbidities including underlying physical and mental health conditions, a history of trauma and ongoing life stressors, generally have poorer outcomes.",
        "answer1":"While some people may be able to recover or self-manage their FND to keep symptoms at bay, and live a full life, others will have a relapsing-remitting illness and many others will develop a chronic form of FND with ongoing disability.",
        "answer2":"Early diagnosis and treatment will give people the best chance of recovery. People who have poor experiences of diagnosis and treatment, ongoing relapses and failure to fully recover between episodes tend to have worse outcomes.",
        "answer3":"Some people will require ongoing disability support to manage in daily life. There is no standard timeline or trajectory in FND, so predictions about recovery or symptom decline cannot be made. There are many factors that influences an individual person’s health and wellbeing, including their social environment, unique coping style and co-morbid medical and mental health conditions. The best advice is to focus on wellbeing, symptom management, keeping a positive attitude and living your best life in the moment, despite any symptoms."
